title: "My name is Maxime Hmae"
---

I'm 25 years old and originally from Strasbourg, France.
I'm a software engineer working primarily with **JavaScript** and **Python**, along with their ecosystems.
My profile is web-oriented, on both the back-end and front-end sides.

I'm currently working at the **University of Strasbourg**.
There, I worked on the Eplouribousse project as well as tools for the Alumni network, among other things.

I come from the Le Wagon bootcamp, complemented by significant self-taught work and numerous phases of personal experimentation.
Today, I'm able to work on **front-end** projects regardless of the technology used, as well as on **back-end** projects in Python.
I also have skills in **CI/CD**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**, which makes me a rather **full stack** profile.

Before web development, I had a career as a professional basketball player.
Coming from the SIG Strasbourg training center, I joined the teams of Souffelweyersheim and Épinal in the 2nd and 3rd divisions.
This experience is a significant milestone in my journey before my career change into development.

Outside of development, I'm interested in politics, music composition, and the non-profit world.
